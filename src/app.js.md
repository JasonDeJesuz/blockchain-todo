Let me explain this code. We have created a new App object that contains all the functions we need to run the JavaScript app. I will explailn the important functions here. For full explanation, watch me explain the JavaScript code in the video at 40:25. Also note that I have commented out a few lines of code that we will enable in later sections.

loadWeb3() web3.js is a JavaScript library that allows our client-side application to talk to the blockchain. We configure web3 here. This is default web3 configuration specified by Metamask. Do not worry if you don't completely understand what is happening here. This is a copy-and-paste implementation that Metamask suggests.
loadContract() This is where we load the smart contract data from the blockchain. We create a JavaScript representation of the smart conract wit the Truffle Contract library. Then we load the smart contract data with web3. This will allow us to list the tasks in the todo list.
renderTasks() This is where we actually list the tasks in the todo list. Notice that we create a for loop to access each task individually. That is because we cannot fetch the entire tasks mapping from the smart contract. We must first determine the taskCount and fetch each task one-by-one.
